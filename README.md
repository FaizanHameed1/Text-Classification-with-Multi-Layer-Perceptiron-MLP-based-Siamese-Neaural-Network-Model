# Text-Classification-with-Multi-Layer-Perceptiron-MLP-based-Siamese-Neaural-Network-Model
In this project we created features vectores(from Text data) using MLP based Siamese Neaural Network. After vector creation KNN and Random Forest models are implimented for text classification.
One of the code file in which we calculated Triplet loss and created vectors is missing(That was task of my colleague), In future i will try to update it in any available time.
